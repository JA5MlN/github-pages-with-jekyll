Dear Diary,

I've thrown myself into coding this past month, but I've been a bit scattered and now feeling like my energy is dipping a little.
I've started coding an app called 'Wishing Fish' which is pretty fun. Also started a Free Code Camp course, a JavaScript course with udemy and a bunch of other stuff.
Lots learned, but how much retained. We'll see.

Dear Diary,

I've thrown myself into coding this past month, but I've been a bit scattered and now feeling like my energy is dipping a little.

I've done the General Assembly free online course, started a Free Code Camp course, and a JavaScript course with udemy. 
All the course challenges have sent me spiralling off creating apps of my own as well. Namely, 'Wishing Fish'.
Anyway, it has all been a bit of a fishing expedition. Pun intended, always. Need to focus.

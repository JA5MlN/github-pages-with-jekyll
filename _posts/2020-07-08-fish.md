Dear Diary,

I've thrown myself into coding this past month, but it has all been a bit of a fishing trip.

- General Assembly freee online course completed
- Free Code camp Web Development Certification
- Udemy Complete JavaScript course 2020
- Lots of ideas for apps and some silly builds to meet course requirements
- Building an app called 'Wishing Fish' as way of testing new knowledge

Time to focus.

(All puns intended)
